# Overview

We developed a JavaScript application called Realm of the Undead to demonstrate our understanding of the JavaScript language. 

The purpose of creating this software was to showcase our proficiency in JavaScript syntax and concepts such as functions, arrays, loops, and event handling. Realm of the Undead is a simple yet engaging game where players defend against waves of zombies using various weapons. Features include a wave-based zombie spawning system, a map editor, a map loader, a CPU pathfinder, Original Artwork, Collision Detection, and more.

You can watch a 4-5 minute demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code on [YouTube](link_to_youtube_demo). The focus of the demo is to share insights into JavaScript language syntax and how it was implemented in the context of the game.
